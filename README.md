## Getting started

### Build image

Build image prior to running this application with either one of the follow commands
1. `docker build`
2. or `make`

### Run code

Run `docker-compose run app` to execute code from docker

## Contribution

### Install developer tools

1. Install `vs code`
2. Install formatting tools `pip3 install black isort pre-commit`
3. Install Git pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install`

** if you having trouble locating `pre-commit` after pip3 install, you can either manually add `/usr/local/bin/pre-commit` to `.bash_profile` or reinstall it with `brew install pre-commit`
